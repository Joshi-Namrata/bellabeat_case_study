# **Bellabeat Case Study**: 
## **How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?**

### **Introduction**:

Bellabeat is the case study project I completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In this project, I am playing the role of a junior data analyst working as a part of the marketing analytics team in the Bellabeat company who has to follow data analysis steps to study consumer fitness data, identify trends, and provide recommendations which can be applicable to one of the Bellabeat products to help guide the company's marketing strategy. 

I have followed the case study road map to include various stages of the data analysis process explaining the steps I took in each of the stages and the tools I used. 


### **Company background and mission**:

Bellabeat is a high-tech company, founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur in 2013, that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. It has a mission to inform and inspire women around the world by collecting data on their activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. 

Bellabeat has grown rapidly and has quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. It has further potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. In order to fulfill that mission, Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth.

## **Ask Phase** :

### **Business Task** 

The business task is to analyze the available smart device usage data(Fitbit consumer data) to see patterns and gain insights into how consumers use a non-Bellabeat smart device. The end goal of the task is to present how these insights could be applicable to Bellabeat consumers using one of their products along with the provision of high level recommendations to guide the company's marketing strategy.

### **Key Stakeholders**

* Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer 
* Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat co-founder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team 
* Bellabeat marketing analytics team

## **Prepare Phase** : 

### **Data Sources**

We can find the dataset to be analyzed in this case study from the FitBit Fitness Tracker in Kaggle which is a CC0: Public Domain dataset made available by the user named Mobius. This dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 to 05.12.2016.

This dataset contains 18 CSV files containing quantitative personal tracker data of 30 eligible FitBit users from 04.12.16 to 05.12.2016. This includes data for daily and minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. There are some files containing data organized in both wide and long formats.

## **Data Limitation**

### **Does the data ROCCC ?**

* **Reliable** : This dataset has a low reliability as it has a small sample size of only 30 eligible Fitbit users which could easily be biased with chances of a sampling bias. It may not be as accurate as it can not be applicable to a broader population.
The dataset is also found to be incomplete as it is missing certain parameters data of some of the users. For example, the weight_loginfo table has data for only 8 distinct users.

* **Original** : It is not original as it is not the primary data from the Fitbit company but instead is a third party data of FitBit users collected through a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.

* **Comprehensive** : It is moderately comprehensive as the dataset contains most of the parameters like daily activity, steps, sleep, weight log and HR which can be matched to the Bellabeat users parameters focused by the company. It is however missing the demographic data of users including the gender and age. This can further limit the validity of conclusions considering the target audience of Bellabeat is women.


* **Current** : This dataset is seven years old and outdated as the survey was conducted in the year 2016 and the dataset was last updated 2 years ago by Mobius.

* **Cited** : This dataset is a third party data collected remotely through a distributed survey which may be biased and unreliable. Hence it is of poor quality making it less credible to make data driven business decisions.

These limitations would mostly be addressed by asking further questions and taking appropriate steps to have credible, accurate and complete data before starting the analysis process in real life projects.

Some of the questions which can be asked to the stakeholders early on to address the data limitation:

* Was the data collected automatically?
* Is there a possibility of getting data from the Fitbit company?
* Was any measure taken to eliminate sampling bias? If so, how?
* Can we get an updated version of this data?
* Is there a possibility to get more data collected for a longer duration?

But, in this case study, it is hard to get those limitations addressed and hence we will proceed using this dataset to clean and organize the data further to analyze it later.

## **Process Step** :

I downloaded the dataset containing all the 18 CSV files in my computer, unzipped the files and stored it in a folder with appropriate file- naming conventions.

I uploaded the files to Microsoft Excel to have a first look at the data. I found many files containing duplicate data stored in both wide and long formats, time measured in minutes, hours and days and some containing merged data from the other files. 

Hence, I decided to discard a few of the files containing duplicate data and minute and hour level outputs for physical activity, sleep, calories and intensities with a plan to instead use the daily data of users.

I finally decided to use the csv files of daily_activity.csv, sleep_day.csv and weight_log_info.csv containing the daily data for activity, sleep and weight log of the Fitbit users. 

I uploaded those selected CSV files to BigQuery as tables in the dataset named fitbit_user_data for further cleaning and analyzing the data. 

### **Data Cleaning Documentation**

I decided to use SQL queries to clean the data from the tables of daily_activity, sleep_day and weight_log_info.

**Cleaning Steps**:

* Identified and removed duplicate rows of data where applicable for each of the three tables using a distinct function, temp table and a ROW_NUMBER() window function.

* Maintained consistency of date and time columns across the tables by creating new columns for the date in the date  format and month and weekday columns by extracting data from the existing datetime columns. 

* Created new tables for the cleaned data by including the formatted columns of data excluding all the unwanted columns of LoggedActivitiesDistance and SedentaryActiveDistance from daily_activity table and Fat from weight_log_info table containing mostly 0 and null values.

* Saved the newly created tables of daily_activity_cleaned, sleep_day_cleaned and weight_log_info_cleaned within the same dataset of fitbit_user_data in BigQuery to be used for analysis. 

The SQL queries and the steps I followed for data cleaning can be found in the [**data_cleaning.sql**](https://github.com/Joshi-Namrata/bellabeat_case_study/blob/main/data_cleaning.sql) file. 

## **Analyze Phase** :

In this phase, the above cleaned data will be examined in SQL to identify patterns, relationships, and insights. This information will further help make informed decisions and improve processes.
I categorized users to a user category/type depending upon the average number of steps they took. 

**User Category**:

* **Very active users** took steps > 9999 
* **Fairly active users** took steps between 7001 and 9999
* **Lightly active users** took steps between 5000 and 7000
* **Sedentary users** took steps < 5000


I further categorized total sleep minutes of users into 3 categories based on average total sleep minutes logged by the users per day.

**Sleep Category**:

* **Less than 6 hours** : Average total sleep minutes < 360.
* **6-8 hours** : Average total sleep minutes between 360- 480.
* **Greater than 8 hours** : Average total sleep minutes > 480.

### **Data Analysis steps**

### **Skills Used**:  
Aggregate functions, case statements, joins, temp table.

* Counted the unique number of users who logged activity data for the data timeframe to ensure how many users wore a fitbit device each day.

* Looked at the average distance covered and calories burnt per day by the users wearing a fitbit device.

* Looked at the percent of average activity distribution vs their average total recorded activity minutes of the users to find out which type of activities users mostly engaged in a day.

* Calculated average distance covered, calories burnt, total steps taken, average of daily activities and sedentary minutes per user category/type. 

* Looked at percentage of average sleep minutes vs average bedtime minutes of each of the users to find any correlation.

* Categorized sleep type depending upon the average sleep minutes of each of the users per day.

* Joined 2 tables of daily_activity_cleaned and sleep_day_cleaned tables to look at average steps taken vs sleep minutes, average activity minutes vs sleep minutes by user category/type daily.

* Joined 2 tables of daily_activity_cleaned and weight_log_info_cleaned tables to look at average calories burnt, daily Steps and sedentary minutes vs average weight and BMI of users who wore fitbit across the data timeframe.

* Joined 2 tables of sleep_day_cleaned and weight_log_info_cleaned tables to look at sleep minutes vs BMI of users wearing fitbit.


The SQL queries I wrote for analyzing the data can be found in the [***data_analysis.sql***](https://github.com/Joshi-Namrata/bellabeat_case_study/blob/main/data_analysis.sql) file. 

## **Share Phase**

In this phase, I have created multiple visualizations using tableau based on the insights gained from the above analysis to help present the key findings to the Bellabeat's executive team in a clear and concise way. 

This would further help guide the company's marketing strategy where I am going to provide high level recommendations based on the above analysis.

The SQL queries I used for creating tables in tableau for data visualizations can be found in [***data_visualization.sql***](https://github.com/Joshi-Namrata/bellabeat_case_study/blob/main/data_visualization.sql) file.

### **Key Findings** : 

Based on the categorized user type where

***Very active users*** took ***steps > 9999***

***Fairly active users*** took ***steps between 7001 and 9999***

***Lightly active users*** took ***steps between 5000 and 7000***

***Sedentary users*** took ***steps < 5000***,

Here are some of the key findings from the analysis.

* User engagement is high with more users wearing their Fitbit device in the month of April as compared to May.


![Alt text](<screenshots/sheet_1.png>)

* Most users wearing their Fitbit device cover a distance between 3 - 6.9 miles and burn calories between 1280-2480 calories on an average per day.

* Very active users taking the most steps in a day burnt the most calories as compared to the other users which is expected but can be a useful measure for the users who are trying to lose weight.

![Alt text](<screenshots/sheet_2.png>)

* Fairly active users spent the least sedentary hours compared to the other user types.

![Alt text](<screenshots/sheet_3.png>)

* Most users spent their activity hours doing light activities in a day compared to other activity types which gradually increased as users started getting more active. 

* 20 out of 24 users were able to get >90% of their sleep time vs the time spent in bed indicating a positive correlation between sleep time duration and time spent in bed.

* Most users are able to get 6-8 hours of sleep during the weekdays especially (Tuesday- Friday) with a few of them getting > 8 hours of sleep mostly on Sunday.

![Alt text](<screenshots/sheet_4.png>)

* Very active users tend to sleep less than other types of users.

![Alt text](<screenshots/sheet_5.png>)

* Sleep hours increase as sedentary hours decrease and lightly active hours increase.

![Alt text](<screenshots/sheet_6.png>)

* There are only 8 unique users who have logged their weight information data and 5 unique users who have recorded sleep have also recorded weight information data which is insufficient to draw patterns applicable to all the users.

These key findings provide some of the valuable insights to how and when users engage in different activity levels and its relation to the sleep hours. 

## **Act Phase** :

In this phase, I have some recommendations to help guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy.  

### **Recommendations** :

* Collect more data to perform better analysis.

* Gather demographic information for women to create results that cater to the target population.

* Offer daily and weekly individual and group fitness challenges to the users to motivate them and encourage them to maintain their activity levels.

* Offer daily and weekly rewards to the users who maintain their activity levels to motivate them.

* Offer a 30-day free trial subscription to attract new users.

* Provide personalized recommendations and coaching to the subscribers to increase their activity levels while educating on diet and maintaining adequate sleep hours.

* Introduce a reduced subscription fee and discounts on new products not only for the consistent users but also the users who refer a family or a friend to increase the user base.

* Promote engaging and short beginner friendly workout videos to maintain user engagement.

* Introduce short podcasts to the subscribers to educate them about health and wellness.

* Provide premium subscribers and members with intermediate and advanced level workout coaching.

## **Conclusion** :

The results indicate that users should engage in more physical activities, reduce their sedentary hours in order to improve their sleep and overall health. 

The above recommendations can help increase user engagement and satisfaction with some helpful incentives to stay motivated and can also attract more users leading to better user retention and revenue for the company.
